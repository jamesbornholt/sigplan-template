\section{Introduction}

Immix is excellent, but could be faster~\citep{immix}. Previous efforts have
focused on making Immix faster by making it do less work. This paper proposes
a novel strategy: make Immix faster by making it do \emph{more work}. 
\todo{this seems like nonsense!}
After all, more work means more results.
