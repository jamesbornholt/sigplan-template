Garbage collectors are slow.
We introduce \emph{super garbage collection}, which combines a garbage collector
with magic.
The super garbage collector makes programs $2\times$ faster on average.
With the super garbage collector, garbage collected languages perform on par
with native languages but with superior safety properties.
